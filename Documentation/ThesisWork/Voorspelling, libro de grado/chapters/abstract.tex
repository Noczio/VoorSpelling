\noindent{The lack of skills and knowledge in a specific subject, as it is in this case Machine Learning, leads students to change their learning path in most cases, or in the best case scenario if students keep studying Artifical Intelligence, the biggest obstacle on the way are applications that do not  meet their academic needs and have high cost prices. It is for such reasons that students are forced to use these means until the free trial runs out, otherwise they have to resort to traditional means such as creating source code to train models, which is not a doable options due to the lack of knowledge that students have in their first years of professional training. It is mainly for these reasons that in the present project it is planned to develop a desktop application for the Windows 10 x64 operative system in the course of eight months starting from August 2020, with the purpose of allowing model selection, hyperparameters, training and prediction based on the supplied dataset to students in their first years of academic courses in careers such as Software Engineering, Systems Engineering and Computer Science, throughout and easy-to-understand user interface and detailed documentation of the built-in functions.}
